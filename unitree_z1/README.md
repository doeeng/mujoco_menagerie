## URDF â†’ MJCF derivation steps

1. Added `<mujoco><compiler balanceinertia="true" discardvisual="false"/></mujoco>` to the URDF's `<robot>` clause in order to preserve visual geometries.
2. Loaded the URDF into MuJoCo and saved a corresponding MJCF.
3. Manually edited the MJCF to use meshes for collision too.
4. Added `scene.xml` which includes the robot, with a textured groundplane, skybox and haze.e.
