# Dynamixel 2R

## Overview

This package contains a simple 2R testbench arm featuring MX-64 and MX-106 dynamixel actuators.

The motor parameters are the best fit using system identification. However, as described in this
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08650v1)), enhanced friction modeling could be used to greatly
improve the fidelity of the simulation of such system.
